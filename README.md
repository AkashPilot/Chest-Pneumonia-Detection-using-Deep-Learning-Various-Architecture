# Chest Xray Pneumonia Detection
<b>Abstract</b>:&nbsp;Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

<b>Cell image pre-processing and compilation of dataset for deep learning</b>:&nbsp;
The images used in this work were whole slide images provided in the PEIR-VM repository built by the University of Alabama in Birmingham. The original whole slide image data contain significant amount of redundant information. In order to achieve good classification accuracy, image segmentation and de-noising are needed to extract only blood cells and remove those redundant image pixels simultaneously. Several effective image processing techniques were used to accurately segment tiles into individual cells.

<b>Task</b>:&nbsp;Now we have to Regcognise the future images and give the prediction result
